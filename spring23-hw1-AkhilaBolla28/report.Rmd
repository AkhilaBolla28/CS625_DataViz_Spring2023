## Git, GitHub

1. *What is your GitHub username?*
   AkhilaBolla28

2. *What is the URL of your remote GitHub repo (created through Mr. Kennedy's exercises)?*
<https://github.com/AkhilaBolla28/myrepo.git>

## R

The command below will load the tidyverse package.  If you have installed R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package, it should display a list of loaded packages and their versions.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown 

1. *Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items*

* Tableau
* OpenRefine
* RStudio

2. *Write a single paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, code, and includes a link. The paragraph does not have to make sense.*
My name is [**Akhila** Bolla](https://github.com/AkhilaBolla28). I am doing my *master's* in ***computer science***. Code example is Two plus Eight equals to `r 2+8`.

3. *Create a level 3 heading*
<h3>Level 3 heading<h3>

## R 

#### Data Visualization Exercises

1. (Q2) *How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?*
```{r}
nrow(mpg)
```
Number of Rows in mpg are : 234

```{r}
ncol(mpg)
```
Number of Columns in mpg are : 11

1. (Q4) *Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.*
```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```

#### Workflow: basics Exercises

1. (Q2) *Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly (`library(tidyverse)` is correct):*

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)

filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```

## Google Colab

1. *What are the URLs of your Google Colab notebooks (both Python and R)?*

Python : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1luojNuj1vosHcq9AjVzkTT3Y6dq3rul9?usp=sharing

R : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MeITxhmp4hofBvmI7iu5pzRrFfAaH2F1?usp=sharing


## Tableau

*Insert your the image of your final bar chart here*

![Sales](./East_sales.png)

1. *What conclusions can you draw from the chart?*

Answer: We can see that Machines, Supplies and Tables sales had a negative profit in 2021. While phones and copiers had a profit margin every year.

## Observable and Vega-Lite

### A Taste of Observable

1. *In the "New York City weather forecast" section, try replacing `Forecast: detailedForecast` with `Forecast: shortForecast`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens?*

Answer: The length of the forecast description is changing.

1. *Under the scatterplot of temperature vs. name, try replacing `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens? How about `markPoint()`?*

Answer: If we replace 'markCircle()' with 'markSquare', then the circle-data points changed to square. If we replace 'markCircle()' with 'markPoint', then the circles would appear.

1. *Under "Pick a location, see the weather forecast", pick a location on the map.  Where was the point you picked near?*

Answer: I picked the point near Alden, KS and able to see weather forecast of that location.

1. *The last visualization on this page is a "fancy" weather chart embedded from another notebook.  Click on the 3 dots next to that chart and choose 'Download PNG'.  Insert the PNG into your report.*

### Charting with Vega-Lite

`markCircle()`

1. *Pass an option of `{ size: 200 }` to `markCircle()`.*

Answer: The size of circular points in the scatter plot increases 200 times.

1. *Try `markSquare` instead of `markCircle`.*

Answer: The data points in the scatter plot changes to square shape.

1. *Try `markPoint({ shape: 'diamond' })`.*

Answer: The shape of each data point in scatter plot changes to diamond.
`vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower")`, ...

1. *Change `Horsepower` to `Acceleration`*

Answer: When we change 'Horsepower' to 'Acceleration', The scatter plot changes by considering X-axis field data as acceleration.

1. *Swap what fields are displayed on the x- and y-axis*

Answer: The plot changes to Miles_per_gallon vs Horsepower.
`vl.tooltip().fieldN("Name")`

1. *Change `Name` to `Origin`.*

Answer: If we change 'Name' and 'Origin' then tooltip show details of origin like USA, Japan and Europe instead of name.
Another example, `count()`

1. *Remove the `vl.y().fieldN("Origin")` line.*

Answer: If we remove the `vl.y().fieldN("Origin")` line, the count will be ungrouped, or else we will get grouped count based on origin.

1. *Replace `count()` with `average("Miles_per_Gallon")`.*

Answer: The graph changes to average values of miles per gallon based on origin instead of counting number of cars.
